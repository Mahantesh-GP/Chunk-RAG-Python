LlamaIndex – Response Evaluation Module (for RAG Optimization)
What is it?

A built-in LLM-as-Judge evaluation framework in LlamaIndex

Used to measure RAG answer quality automatically

Eliminates manual or subjective evaluation

What does it evaluate?

Faithfulness – Is the answer grounded in retrieved chunks (hallucination check)

Relevancy – Does the answer correctly address the user query?

Correctness / Similarity – (Optional) Matches expected answers

Guideline adherence – Follows response rules (if defined)

Why used in Chunk Size Experiment?

Same dataset + same questions

Run RAG with different chunk sizes

Compare scores → data-driven decision on optimal granularity

Finds the best trade-off between context & precision

How it works (High-level Flow)

Generate queries from documents

Run RAG pipeline

Pass Query + Retrieved Context + Response

LLM evaluates and returns score + pass/fail

Key Value

Objective RAG quality metrics

Faster tuning of chunk size & retrieval strategy

Reduces hallucination risk

Ideal for enterprise RAG validation

One-line takeaway (bottom of slide)

“LlamaIndex Response Evaluation enables automated, LLM-based quality scoring of RAG responses—making chunk size selection evidence-driven instead of guesswork.”


Why This Matters (Bottom strip of slide)

Reduces hallucinations

Improves answer accuracy

Enables scientific tuning of RAG systems

Essential for enterprise-grade RAG

One-liner for presenter notes

“Instead of guessing the best chunk size, LlamaIndex evaluates RAG responses using an LLM judge and gives us measurable scores like faithfulness and relevancy.”
